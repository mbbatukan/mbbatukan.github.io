# Seismic performance of modular steel buildings (MSBs) equipped with resilient slip friction joints (RSFJs)

## Abstract
Modular construction is becoming a prevalent technique combining off-site construction and on-site assembly to provide fast, reliable and high-quality permanent buildings. The modular method is a good alternative to traditional on-site construction when the layout consists of repetitive units such as hotels and multifamily dwellings, and when the construction schedule is tight. The dynamic performance of Modular Steel Buildings (MSBs) has not yet been fully studied, and a limited number of investigations on the nonlinear dynamic behavior of MSBs showed that they are susceptible to damage during strong ground motions. This paper considers the use of a self-centering energy dissipation device, called Resilient Slip Friction Joint (RSFJ), in MSBs to avoid seismic damage, enable immediate occupancy, and reduce the repair costs after a severe earthquake event. Two different configurations of RSFJs (namely tension-compression and tension-only configurations) were introduced to Seismic Force Resisting Systems (SFRSs) of 6- and 12-story MSBs. This study presents a step-by-step design procedure by following the capacity design for RSFJs in accordance to National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). The dynamic performances of both configurations were evaluated by performing bi-directional Nonlinear Time History Analysis (NLTHA). In addition to global response of MSBs, component level maximum demands of RSFJs were assessed to shed a light on the overall performance of MSBs under three different hazard levels. It was shown that low- and mid-rise MSBs can efficiently be equipped with RSFJ to mitigate earthquake-induced vibrations and minimize the damage to the structural members.
