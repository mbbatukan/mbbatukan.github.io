CRACKING CAPTCHAS USING DEEP LEARNING
=====================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of the machine learning project is to test the security and suggest improvements to CAPTCHAs1. To tackle this problem, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve text-based CAPTCHAs. The final results inform decisions on whether text-based CAPTCHAs are useful in the current environment and which distortions are best for security.
