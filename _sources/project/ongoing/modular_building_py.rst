ModularBuildingPy
=================

``ModularBuildingPy`` is a Python module designed to create linear or nonlinear numerical models for volumetric modular steel buildings using the finite element method (FEM). It leverages the power of ``OpenSeesPy``, a Python library for the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees).

.. note::

    The module is currently under development. The source code and documentation will be published in mid- or late 2024.
