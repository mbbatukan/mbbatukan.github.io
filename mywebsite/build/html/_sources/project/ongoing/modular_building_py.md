# ModularBuildingPy

ModularBuildingPy is a Python module designed to create linear or nonlinear numerical models for volumetric modular steel buildings using the finite element method (FEM). It leverages the power of OpenSeesPy, a Python library for the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees).

The module is currently under development. The source code along with the documentation will be published Mid or Late 2024.
